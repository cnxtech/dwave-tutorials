README for Logic Gates
======================

Classical logic gates are electronic circuits that implement boolean
logic. Boolean logic (or boolean algebra) is a mathematical system where
the only two possible values are TRUE and FALSE.

I have included tutorials for implementing logic gates because (1) many
people are very familiar with logic gates or boolean logic, and (2)
there is a special technique on the D-Wave that lets you run logic
gates either forward or backwards. This technique has many interesting
applications such as factoring numbers and reverse engineering digital
circuits.
