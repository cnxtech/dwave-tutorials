TODO for dwave-tutorials Repository
===================================

- Add more fun tutorials. (Always!)
- Add a tutorial directory for every major D-Wave Ocean tool. These
  directories will probably live under a dwave-ocean directory.
  The current list of tools includes:

   - dimod (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dimod/en/latest/index.html)
   - dwavebinarycsp (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/binarycsp/en/latest/index.html)
   - dwave-cloud-client (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/cloud-client/en/latest/index.html)
   - dwave_neal (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/neal/en/latest/index.html)
   - dwave_networkx (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dwave-networkx/en/latest/index.html)
   - dwave-system (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system/en/latest/index.html)
   - penaltymodel (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/penaltymodel/en/latest/index.html)
   - minorminer (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/minorminer/en/latest/index.html)
   - qbsolv (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/qbsolv/en/latest/index.html)

- Add directory for embedding tutorials.
- Add directory for graph threory problems.
- Add directory for risk analysis problems.
- Add directory for game theory problems.

User Feedback
-------------

Above all else, new tutorials should be motivated by user feedback.
I make no promises, but if there is a tutorial you want to see,
ask for it.
